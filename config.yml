# FAQ:
#   - "Why IP Logging?": Needed for identifying players in the serverlist by their IP. Used in %player%, %money"
#      You can turn it off if you have to comply with some data protection law. IPs and UUIDs of players are
#      stored locally inside the IP_UUID.dat. 
#   - "Connection turns red in serverlist with VersionText on.": Ever seen when your server is outdated in the 
#      serverlist? SMOTD simulates this and changes the text. This is just cosmetical!
#   - "Plugin ServerlistMOTD_10.0.3_ created a profile with 'HoverText' as an UUID.": Your HoverText normally
#      contains a list of players. SMOTD clears that and creates a fake player with your text as its name.
