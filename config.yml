# FAQ:
#   - "Why IP Logging?": Needed for identifying players in the serverlist by their IP. Used in %player%, %money"
#      IPs and UUIDs of players are stored locally inside the IP_UUID.dat.
#   - "Connection turns red in serverlist with VersionText on.": Ever seen when your server is outdated in the
#      serverlist? SMOTD simulates this and changes the text. This is just cosmetical!
#   - "Plugin ServerlistMOTD created a profile with 'HoverText' as an UUID.": Your HoverText normally
#      contains a list of players. SMOTD clears that and creates a fake player with your text as its name.
#   - "What is Regulars and Newbies?" Players are categorized in those two groups in the list. Regular players
#      are known by their ip while newbies are not.
#   - "Player related placeholders from PlaceholderAPI are not working!": This is a known limitation. All this
#      information is not available in the serverlist because the player isn't online.
