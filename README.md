### Support

I started developing ServerlistMOTD in 2014 and slowly shifted away my focus from Spigot development. I did a small rewrite due to bad code in old versions and I dropped Bungeecord support. 

**This project is officially discontinued!** (I will probably look into it from time to time though.)
