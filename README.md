The developer of ProtocolLib recommends using [ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) with Spigot 1.16 to allow 1.17 player to join. In this case, you can use the latest version ProtocolLib and X-2020-09-05 with all features just fine. If you want a 1.17 server, this lite version is for you.

### General 

A plugin for the Spigot API. ServerlistMOTD allows you to change your MOTD in the serverlist. You can set custom MOTDs for known players or welcome new players with a special MOTD to get the players attention. This plugin is HIGHLY compatibile with old and new versions of Bukkit/Spigot!

### Support

I started developing ServerlistMOTD in 2014 and slowly shifted away my focus from Spigot development. I did a small rewrite due to bad code in old versions and I dropped Bungeecord support. 

**This project is officially discontinued!** (I will probably look into it from time to time though.)
